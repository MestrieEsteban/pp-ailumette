### = Prelude

Aillumette is a game based on matches.
- There are a number of match lines.
- The players take turns.
- Each player can take one or more matches on the same line.
- The player who loses is the one who takes the last match.

### = Sample

> With node.js (but language-free)

```sh
$ node ailumette

### = How

The goal of the project is to make a program that we can play against.
- The basic version must generate a tray of 4 lines of matches
- The output of your program (including error messages) must correspond to examples established above and be written to standard output.
- After the last message (which indicates the winner), there is only one return to the line
- In case of wrong entry to indicate the number of matches to be removed, it is necessary re-display Line: and it's up to the player to re-enter the line on which
he wants to play.
